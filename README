Instructions:

Run 'mvn jetty:run' and open your browser to localhost:8080

Make src/main/webapp/index.html adjustments and hit refresh as necessary (css,
images and javascript are available under src/main/webapp/static/assets/).

When happy, move the changes to template.html, but remember to remove
all of the simulated content (nav bar, overview, blog posts, etc).

Ensure all static references start with a forward slash '/' e.g.:

/static/assets/images/foo.jpg
/static/assets/css/...

The template.html file is the one that should be uploaded to the Confluence Auto Export plugin.

When done, commit your changes!
